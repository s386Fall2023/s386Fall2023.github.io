Objective:  Setup the tools that we'll be using this semester in Stat 386.

Instructions: Follow the direction below to install Git, Anaconda, and VS Code; and to set up your GitHub account.


## 1. Install Git
1. Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/) onto your computer (version should be 2.33 or greater)
    * Verify that the installation was successful:
        - On a mac: Open the terminal and type `git --version`.  It should return `git version X.XX.XX` (with the version number)
        - On a PC: Verify that you have "git bash".  Open "git bash" and type `git --version` to verify your version number.

2. Configure git 
    * Configure git on your computer with your name, email, and text editor of choice.
    * Change the default branch to "main" (instead of "master")

2. Setup your Github profile:
    * Add a picture
    * Add your name
    * Add a brief bio
    * Create a [profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
3. Grant Github access to your computer:
    In order for you to be able "push" changes from your computer to Github, your Github needs to recognize your computer as having permission to do so.  You will need to use ONE of the following methods:
    * OAuth token
    * [SSH keys]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/resources/sshsetup)
