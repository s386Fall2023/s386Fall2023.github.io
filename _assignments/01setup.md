Objective:  Setup the tools that we'll be using this semester in Stat 386.

Instructions: Follow the direction below to install Git, Anaconda, and VS Code; and to set up your GitHub account.


## 1. Install Git
1. Download and install [git](https://git-scm.com/) onto your computer (version should be 2.33 or greater)
    * Verify that the installation was successful:
        - On a mac: Open the terminal and type `git --version`.  It should return `git version X.XX.XX` (with the version number)
        - On a PC: Verify that you have "git bash".  Open "git bash" and type `git --version` to verify your version number.

2. Configure git in the terminal
    * Name: ```git config --global use.name "YourFirst AndLastName```
    * Email: ```git config --global user.email "your_valid_email@sample.com```
    * Text editor: ```git config --global core.editor "code --wait"``` (This command sets the editor to VS Code.  Click [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C%3A-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config) for other options.)
    * Default branch: ```git config --global init.defaultBranch main```

## 2. Install Anaconda 
1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) onto your computer
2. If you already have Anaconda installed, be sure it is up to date by opening a terminal (or the Anaconda prompt in Windows) and typing
```conda update conda```

---
## 3. Install VS Code
1. Download and install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

---
## 4. Setup Github
1. Create a [Github](https://github.com/) account (if you haven't already done so)
2. Setup your Github profile:
    * Add a picture
    * Add your name
    * Add a brief bio
    * Create a [profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
3. Grant Github access to your computer:
    In order for you to be able "push" changes from your computer to Github, your Github needs to recognize your computer as having permission to do so.  You will need to use ONE of the following methods:
    * [SSH keys]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/resources/sshsetup)
    * [Passkey](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/authenticating-with-a-passkey/about-passkeys) 
    * [Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) 
    * *I use SSH keys and I don't have experience with the other methods but will definitely help you figure it out if necessary.*
